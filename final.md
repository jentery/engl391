# Player Story (Rough Draft to Be Refined in Mid-March)

A "Player Story" is a methodology [my lab](https://uvicpraxis.github.io/) developed to evaluate what genres do in games. It is grounded in activity theory, and it treats games as activity systems. It draws from neoclassical, structuralist, post-romantic, reader response, and cultural studies of genre. 

A Player Story documents the following experiences of a games and genres:

* Playing and reacting to them,
* Making meaning of them,
* Being affected by them, and
* Arguing with them and all their generative contradictions.

A Player Story is, in the words of [Kishonna Gray](http://www.kishonnagray.com/), a "narrative description" of a game as a system of activities. Player Stories are both personal and social, and their authors toggle between immersion and critical distance.

The two most common formats for Player Stories are:

* Video essays with voice-over narration and
* Written essays with images and/or embedded media such as video, images, and audio.
