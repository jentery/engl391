# Player Story (Rough Draft to Be Refined in Mid-March)

A "Player Story" is a methodology [my lab](https://uvicpraxis.github.io/) developed to evaluate what genres do in games. It is grounded in activity theory, and it treats games as activity systems. It draws from neoclassical, structuralist, post-romantic, reader response, and cultural studies of genre. 

A Player Story documents the following experiences of games and genres:

* Playing and reacting to them,
* Making meaning of them,
* Being affected by them, and
* Arguing with them and all their generative contradictions.

A Player Story is, in the words of [Kishonna Gray](http://www.kishonnagray.com/), a "narrative description" of a game as a system of activities. Player Stories are both personal and social, and their authors toggle between immersion and critical distance.

The two most common formats for Player Stories are:

* Video essays with voice-over narration and
* Written essays with images and/or embedded media such as video and audio.

I am asking you to compose your own Player Story for your final project in this course. You can focus on a single game selected from [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0). 

## Format and Audience 

You are welcome to choose *one* of the following approaches to a Player Story for the sake of your own research in this class: 

* A video essay (8-12 minutes) with voice-over narration. 
* A written essay (2000-2500 words) with images and/or embedded media.
* Another approach, which you should propose by email to me before 11:30am on Friday, March 17th. Labour-wise, this approach should correspond roughly with the minute and word counts provided above: 8-12 minutes or 2000-2500 words. 

Whichever approach you select, you should also include: 

* Three sentences describing the project for your intended audience. Please make clear who that audience is. You can include these three sentences at the beginning of your Player Story (in the document or video) *or* in the comments section of the Brightspace submission form for the Player Story assignment. 

Your intended audience need not be an academic one, yet they *should* be a community who contributes in some way to the game you selected. (See the "Video Games as Activity Systems" diagram for the "community" element of an activity system.)

You are more than welcome to draw conventions from genres such as the Let's Play for this assignment. Your Player Story can, for instance, use first-person language, make observations or arguments from lived experience, comment on the game in real-time (as you or someone else plays it), and even address its audience directly (i.e., "break the fourth wall"). 

Your Player Story does not need to be a conventional essay or academic argument; however, it should engage a secondary or tertiary contradiction in a way that demonstrates critical thinking about games, genre, and activity theory (see "Aims" below for more).

If you prefer to write academically, perhaps because you're most familiar with the genre of the academic essay, then you are more than welcome approach your Player Story accordingly. It may resemble ethnographic writing or even literary studies this way. That said, even if your Player Story is academic in style and tone, some or all of it should be written in first-person language. (See "Aims" below for more information.)

I may refine the format of the Player Story after I assess your responses to the Activity Analysis prompt. No revisions I make will increase your workload or dramatically alter the structure and expectations of this assignment. 

## Aims

Your Player Story should: 

* *Document the experience of playing* a game, reacting to it, making meaning of it, being affected by it, and even arguing with it. (See the "Video Game Documentation" handout for more on what constitutes "documentation.")
* *Narrate that experience for your intended audience* by treating the game as an activity system in which you're participating. (See the "Video Games as Activity Systems" diagram for the elements of an activity system.)
* *Address how a genre set functions as an activity* in the game to mediate relations between participants and their motives. One of these participants should be *you*, the player, hence the expectations of some first-person language in the Player Story. (See "Format and Audience" above for more.)
* *Engage a secondary or tertiary contradiction in the game's activities* as you experienced them. This contradiction should be the "problem" or topic at *the core of your Player Story*, and your Player Story should communicate for whom the contradiction matters and why it's important today. (We will discuss secondary and tertiary contradictions during class in February and March.)
* *Express a clear theme or line of inquiry* your audience can follow from start to finish. This should be the "glue" or "thread" that brings your Player Story together and sustains it for your intended audience. 
* *Be intentionally designed and scoped* such that it does not try to address every aspect of the game or all topics related to it. 
* *Demonstrate a palpable awareness of your intended audience* and provide them (via documentation) with access to parts of the game. 

I may refine the aims of the Player Story after I assess your responses to the Activity Analysis prompt. No revisions I make will increase your workload or dramatically alter the structure and expectations of this assignment. 

## Academic Integrity 

By responding to this assignment, you confirm that: 

* You followed UVic academic regulations and observed standards of scholarly integrity (e.g., no plagiarism or cheating). 
* You completed this assignment *individually* and not with a friend, classmate, or group.
* Your response is your own, excluding quoted and paraphrased material that is clearly cited. 
* You cited any sources, including assigned reading and internet sources, that you used to answer the questions. 

## Assessment 

By mid-March, I will use [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) to construct assessment criteria for this assignment *after* I assess your responses to the Activity Analysis prompt. Thank you for your patience. 

For now, please know: 

* 1 point will be deducted for every 25 words or every 10 seconds over the limit. 
* 10 points will be deducted if no works cited / references page is included at the end of the response.
* Your mark for the Player Story will constitute 30% of your final mark in this course. 

## What to Submit 

Please submit the following materials for your Player Story: 

* Three sentences describing the project for its intended audience. 
* The Player Story itself: a video essay (8-12 minutes) with voice-over narration, a written essay (2000-2500 words) with images and/or embedded media such as video and audio, or another approach I approved via email. 
* A list of works cited / references at the end of your Player Story (in the document or video). You are welcome to use your preferred citation style (MLA, Chicago, or APA, e.g.). 

You can submit your Player Story as a DOCX, ODT, PAGES, PDF, MOV, MP4, or HTML file with attachments (video, audio, images, or text) where applicable. 

Please do not forget to cite *games* from which you draw examples. Parenthetical citations of games are not necessary, but reference entries are. Here's a sample MLA reference entry for a game we've studied in class: 

* Han-Tani, Melos and Marina Kittaka. *Even the Ocean*. Analgesic Productions, 2016. 

Columns A, B, C, and D in [this spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/3Im7Tg8) provide you with all the information you need to reference games in the course. 

Finally, you are welcome to use this MLA reference entry for Bawarshi and Reiff's work when quoting or paraphrasing it in any of your responses: 

* Bawarshi, Anis S. and Mary Jo Reiff. *Genre: An Introduction to History Theory Research and Pedagogy*. Parlor Press, 2010.

## When to Submit It

Please submit your Player Story by Tuesday, April 18th at 11:30am.

I will deduct *five* points per working day (excluding holidays and weekends) for every submission I receive after Wednesday, April 19th at 11:30am. This gives you one day of wiggle room for your final project. I will close the Brightspace submission portal for the Player Story assignment at 11:30am on Monday, April 24th.
