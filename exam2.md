# Take-Home Exam 2 

This is your second and final exam in English 391, and it covers material and meetings from Tuesday, February 7th through Friday, March 17th.

The exam is *open-book*, meaning you are allowed to use your notes, assigned readings, the library, and the internet to respond to the questions.

You are *not* expected to refer to anything other than English 391 lectures (including your notes), Volume 2 of the "Video Game Documentation" media collection (in Brightspace), and "Rhetorical Genre Studies" by Anis S. Bawarshi and Mary Jo Reiff.

## Download the Exam 

Please [download the exam](english391Exam2.docx) (DOCX format) to complete it in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Pages for Mac. You are also welcome to copy the questions and paste them into a word processor to answer them. I do not recommend this approach because it's riskier than simply downloading the exam. If you nevertheless decide to copy and paste the questions, then please ensure you include the Academic Integrity statement and a list of works cited / references (see below) in your response to the exam. 

If you need the exam in a format other than DOCX, then please let me know ASAP, and I'll make it happen ASAP. 

Note that the downloadable copy of the exam does *not* contain all the information on this page, which you should read *before* responding to the exam.
