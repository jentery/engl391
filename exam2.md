# Take-Home Exam 2 

This is your second and final exam in English 391, and it covers material and meetings from Tuesday, February 7th through Friday, March 17th.

The exam is *open-book*, meaning you are allowed to use your notes, assigned readings, the library, and the internet to respond to the questions.

You are *not* expected to refer to anything other than English 391 lectures (including your notes), Volume 2 of the "Video Game Documentation" media collection (in Brightspace), and "Rhetorical Genre Studies" by Anis S. Bawarshi and Mary Jo Reiff.

## Download the Exam 

Please [download the exam](english391Exam2.docx) (DOCX format) to complete it in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Pages for Mac. You are also welcome to copy the questions and paste them into a word processor to answer them. I do not recommend this approach because it's riskier than simply downloading the exam. If you nevertheless decide to copy and paste the questions, then please ensure you include the Academic Integrity statement and a list of works cited / references (see below) in your response to the exam. 

If you need the exam in a format other than DOCX, then please let me know ASAP, and I'll make it happen ASAP. 

Note that the downloadable copy of the exam does *not* contain all the information on this page, which you should read *before* responding to the exam. 

## Aims

This exam has two aims for the purposes of this course, namely for you to: 

1. Cover foundations in activity theory *before* you proceed with your own project (i.e., your [Player Story](final.html)) in this course. 
2. Demonstrate your knowledge of key terms from the second half of this course. These terms include metagame, environmental storytelling, player story, and secondary and tertiary contradiction. 

## Format

This open-book exam is ten short-answer questions divided into two sections, which have distinct assessment criteria. 

## Academic Integrity 

By responding to this exam, you confirm that: 

* You followed UVic academic regulations and observed standards of scholarly integrity (e.g., no plagiarism or cheating). 
* You completed this exam *individually* and not with a friend, classmate, or group.
* You did not share your answers with anyone else, including your peers in this course, at any time. 
* You did not give or receive any aid on this exam. (The use of a spell and/or grammar checker on your computer is permitted.)
* Each response to every exam question is your own, excluding quoted and paraphrased material that is clearly cited. 
* You cited any sources, including assigned reading and internet sources, that you used to answer the exam questions. 

## Section 1 

Each of the following questions is worth *5 points* for a total of 25 points in this section. Your responses should demonstrate your *understanding* of pertinent course material, including lectures, assigned reading, and discussions. (See "Assessment" below for details.) 

*Point form and incomplete sentences are preferred.* Please do not use more than *100 words* per response. (I will use a word counting tool during assessment.) Do not include audio, images, or video in your answers. You are welcome to quote or paraphrase my lectures and lecture notes in your answers. 

1. Provide *three* working definitions of "metagame" in the context of video games. 
2. Identify and briefly describe *three* types of metagames in the context of video games. 
3. Use lecture material in this course to define a "secondary contradiction" in the activity theory of video games and then communicate that definition in your own words.  
4. Use lecture material in this course to define a "tertiary contradiction" in the activity theory of video games and then communicate that definition in your own words. 
5. Define a "player story" in the activity theory of video games and then include a URL (i.e., a web address) of *one* example. (The URL aspect of this question will only be assessed on *whether you included the URL* and *not whether the content is a compelling example* of a player story. Just do your best to think of an example and then point me to it.)
