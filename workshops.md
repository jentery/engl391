# Workshops

The prompt for this assignment is coming soon. 

I will facilitate a series of writing and research workshops in late March. They will help you to refine your Player Story well before it’s due on Tuesday, April 18th. During these workshops, I will distribute worksheets for you to complete with peers in small groups and then return to me for assessment.
