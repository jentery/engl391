# Activity Analysis

This assignment prompts you to attend to various aspects of the [game you selected](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) to study this term and to treat that game as an activity system. It should also prepare you to compose your [player story](final.html) for this course. 

## Before You Respond

* Review the ten questions below and email me any questions you have. 
* Also review the "Video Games as Activity Systems" diagram I shared during class in February. 
* Select a game from [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0).
* Play the game for at least an hour. You do *not* need to complete it to respond to this prompt. 
* Document the game and your experience as you play it. Keep those ten questions in mind as you do. Your documentation doesn't need to be high-tech. You can use your phone (if you have one) to take photos or a computer or console to take screen grabs. You'll want at least four images or videos.
