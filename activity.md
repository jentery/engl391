# Activity Analysis

This assignment preps you to compose your [player story](final.html) by prompting you to attend to a game and treat it as an activity system. 

## Before You Respond

* Review the ten questions below and email me any concerns you have. 
* Also review the "Video Games as Activity Systems" diagram I shared during class in February. 
* Select a game from [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) to study this term. 
* Play that game for at least an hour but ideally two. You do *not* need to complete the game or roll credits to respond to this prompt. 
* Document the game and your experience as you play it. Keep those ten questions in mind as you do. Your documentation doesn't need to be high-tech. You can use either your phone (if you have one) to take photos or a computer or console to take screen grabs. You'll want at least four images or videos for this assignment.  

## Download the Assignment

Please download the assignment (DOCX format) to complete it in a word processor. You are also welcome to copy and paste the questions to answer them. I do not recommend this approach because it's riskier than simply downloading the assignment. If you nevertheless decide to copy and paste the questions, then please ensure you include the Academic Integrity statement and a list of works cited / references (see below) in your response. 

If you need the exam in a format other than DOCX, then please let me know ASAP, and I'll make it happen ASAP. 

Note that the downloadable copy of the assignment does *not* contain all the information on this page, which you should read *before* responding to the prompt.  

## Aims

For you to: 

* Demonstrate your knowledge of activity theory and apply it to genre studies of games.  
* Describe and analyze a [game](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) by treating it as an activity system. 
* Document that game and your experience as you play it, and
* Communicate what you learned to other people in this course, including me. 

## Format and Audience 

This assignment consists of ten short-answer questions accompanied by video game documentation (four videos or images). 

Your audience consists of your peers and me. You can assume we have played the game you selected and understand the fundamentals of activity theory and genre studies.   

## Academic Integrity 

By responding to this assignment, you confirm that: 

* You followed UVic academic regulations and observed standards of scholarly integrity (e.g., no plagiarism or cheating). 
* You completed this assignment *individually* and not with a friend, classmate, or group.
* Each response to every question is your own, excluding quoted and paraphrased material that is clearly cited. 
* You cited any sources, including assigned reading and internet sources, that you used to answer the questions. 

## The Ten Questions

Each of the following questions is worth *10 points* for a total of 100 points. Your responses should demonstrate your *understanding and application* of pertinent course material, including activity theory, lectures, assigned reading, and discussions. (See "Assessment" below for details.) 

*Complete sentences are preferred.* Please do not use more than *150 words* per response. (I will use a word counting tool during assessment.) 

All supporting game documentation should be yours, and you should only include an image or video when the question asks for one. You can attach a file by uploading it separately to Brightspace (recommended), or you can insert it directly into the document. If you attach it, then be sure to refer to the filename (e.g., "see portal2Mechanic.png" or "see evenTheOceanArt.mov") in your writing. Any video you attach or insert should be no longer than *30 seconds*. 

1. Which game did you select to study in this course? Please mention the game's title, developer(s), publisher(s), and release date in your response. (This question should be an easy ten points.)
2. Identify and describe *one* interesting story element in the game you selected. Why is it interesting? Include supporting game documentation (a video or image) and refer to it in your response.  
3. Identify and describe *one* interesting art or design element in the game you selected. Why is it interesting? Attach supporting game documentation (a video or image) and refer to it in your response. 
4. Identify and describe *one* interesting mechanic or challenge in the game you selected. Why is it interesting? Attach supporting game documentation (a video or image) and refer to it in your response. 
5. Identify *one* genre set in the game you selected and explain how it coordinates narrative with art and mechanics. Attach supporting game documentation (a video or image) and refer to it in your writing.
