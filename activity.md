# Activity Analysis

This assignment prompts you to attend to the [game you selected](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) to study this term by treating it as an activity system. The assignment should also prepare you to compose your [player story](final.html) for the course. 

## Before You Respond

* Review the ten questions below and email me any concerns you have. 
* Also review the "Video Games as Activity Systems" diagram I shared during class in February. 
* Select a game from [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) to study this term. 
* Play the game for at least an hour (but ideally two). You do *not* need to complete it to respond to this prompt. 
* Document the game and your experience as you play it. Keep those ten questions in mind as you do. Your documentation doesn't need to be high-tech. You can use your phone (if you have one) to take photos or a computer or console to take screen grabs. You'll want at least four images or videos for this assignment.  

## Download the Assignment

Please download the assignment (DOCX format) to complete it in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Pages for Mac. You are also welcome to copy the questions and paste them into a word processor to answer them. I do not recommend this approach because it's riskier than simply downloading the assignment. If you nevertheless decide to copy and paste the questions, then please ensure you include the Academic Integrity statement and a list of works cited / references (see below) in your response. 

If you need the exam in a format other than DOCX, then please let me know ASAP, and I'll make it happen ASAP. 

Note that the downloadable copy of the assignment does *not* contain all the information on this page, which you should read *before* responding to the prompt.  

## Aims

* Demonstrate your knowledge of activity theory and apply it to genre studies of games.  
* Describe the [game you selected](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) to study this term by treating it as an activity system. 
* Document your play and experiences with that game, and
* Communicate what you've learned thus far to other people in this course, including me.
