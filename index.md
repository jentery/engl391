# tl;dr Version of this Syllabus

In a rush? Overwhelmed by the start of term? Need a guide to steward you through this course?

I made a one-page, [tl;dr version of this syllabus](guide.html) for you. I'll print you a [PDF copy](guide.pdf), too. This guide is not intended to replace the syllabus, but I hope it's convenient in a pinch. 

# Course Description 

Games prompt us to play, but how do we tell stories with them? And how do those stories correspond with the conventions and expectations of genre? We'll survey the articulation of game genres (such as point-and-click, puzzle, role-playing, sim, and platformer) with literary genres (like fantasy, science fiction, mystery, adventure, and horror) to consider how each affects our understanding, if not our experience, of narrative and play. Then we'll attend to story-rich games that experiment with genre or invent their own. I'll ask you to select a game to study throughout the term, and I'll assume you've no previous experience with games or genre studies. As the course unfolds, you'll learn to write critically about both genre and games and explain why they matter today.  

# Aims 

I designed this course for you to:

* Develop a vocabulary for approaching genre in the context of games and interactive fiction. 
* Interpret what genre *does* and how it behaves across play and narrative in interactive environments. 
* Communicate critically about games and genre for non-expert audiences. 
* Use play as evidence by documenting games when you write about genre.  

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: “JEN-tree.” I spend 14.32% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about audio, games, and fiction. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. I've been at UVic, on lək̓ʷəŋən and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ territories, since 2011. I teach courses for UVic English, and I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca) or find me in CLE D331.
