# Description

Video games prompt us to play, but how do we tell stories with them? And how do genres shape that storytelling? We'll survey the articulation of video game genres (such as point-and-click, puzzle, role-playing, sim, and platformer) with literary genres (like fantasy, science fiction, mystery, adventure, and horror) to consider how genre affects our understanding, if not our experiences, of narrative and play. We'll attend to short, story-rich games that experiment with genre, and I'll ask you to [select a game](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) to study throughout the term. 

# Learning Goals

I designed this course for you to: 

1. Build a vocabulary for approaching genre as an action instead of a category.
2. Learn a methodology for analyzing what genres *do* in video games and how they mediate the motives and objectives of players.
3. Document, describe, and evaluate the activity of multiple genres in a single game. 
4. Compose your own "player story" *with* a game, not just *about* a game. This means you will interact and relate with the game as a process or system instead of treating it like a distinct object to be examined from a distance. (I define "player story" in the next section of this syllabus.)

I'll assume you've no previous experience with games or genre studies in an academic context.
