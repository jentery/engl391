# tl;dr of this Syllabus

In a rush? Overwhelmed by the start of term? Need a "big picture" guide to steward you through this course?

I made a one-page, [tl;dr version of this syllabus](guide.html) for you. I'll print you a [PDF copy](guide.pdf), too. This guide is not intended to replace the syllabus, but I hope it's convenient in a pinch.
