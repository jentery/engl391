# tl;dr of this Syllabus

In a rush? Overwhelmed by the start of term? Need a guide to steward you through this course?

I made a one-page, [tl;dr version of this syllabus](guide.html) for you. I'll print you a [PDF copy](guide.pdf), too. This guide is not intended to replace the syllabus, but I hope it's convenient in a pinch. 

# Description 

Games prompt us to play, but how do we tell stories with them? And how do those stories correspond with the conventions and expectations of genre? We'll survey the articulation of game genres (such as point-and-click, puzzle, role-playing, sim, and platformer) with literary genres (like fantasy, science fiction, mystery, adventure, and horror) to consider how it affects our understanding, if not our experiences, of narrative and play. Then we'll attend to story-rich games that experiment with genre or invent their own. I'll ask you to select a game to study throughout the term, and I'll assume you've no previous experience with games or genre studies. As the course unfolds, you'll learn to write critically about both genre and games and explain why they matter today.  

# Aims 

I designed this course for you to:

* Develop a vocabulary for approaching genre in the context of games and interactive fiction. 
* Interpret what genre *does* and how it behaves across play and narrative in interactive environments. 
* Communicate critically about games and genre for non-expert audiences. 
* Use play as evidence by documenting games when you write about genre.  

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: “JEN-tree.” I spend 14.32% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about audio, games, and fiction. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. I've been at UVic, on lək̓ʷəŋən and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ territories, since 2011. I teach courses for UVic English, and I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca) or find me in CLE D331. 

# Games

I am asking you to select *one* of the following games to study and play throughout the term. I will touch upon each of these games at some point during lectures (often with screen caps and recordings) but will go into depth about only a few of them. (See the schedule below for details.) To make this list, I focused on games published since 2010 that are story-rich, cost less than 30 CAD, are available on multiple platforms (ideally one that's mobile), and require no more than ten hours to complete, hence the absence of notable works such as *Disco Elysium*, *Inscryption*, *Mass Effect 2*, *Pentiment*, and *Outer Wilds*.

I recommend reviewing [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) before selecting one of these games to study for the term. It includes the tagline, game genre(s), literary genre(s), cameras and perspectives, average cost, platforms (including mobile), average number of hours to completion, content warnings, and URL for each game, plus some notes. If you encounter any errors or mistakes, then please let me know. I'll correct them. 

Again, please pick only *one* game from the following list to study this term.

* *80 Days* (2014)
* *Butterfly Soup* (2017)
* *Card Shark* (2022)
* *Citizen Sleeper* (2022)
* *Eliza* (2019)
* *Even the Ocean* (2016) 
* *Firewatch* (2016)
* *Get in the Car, Loser!* (2021) 
* *Gris* (2018)
* *Immortality* (2022) 
* *Inside* (2016)
* *Kentucky Route Zero* (2013-20)
* *Neo Cab* (2019)
* *Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna)* (2014)
* *Night in the Woods* (2017) 
* *NORCO* (2022)
* *Oxenfree* (2016)
* *Portal 2* (2011)
* *Return of the Obra Dinn* (2018)
* *Signalis* (2022)
* *Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe* (2022) 
* *Strange Horticulture* (2022)
* *That Dragon, Cancer* (2016)
* *To The Moon* (2011) 
* *Umurangi Generation* (2020)
* *Unpacking* (2021) 
* *When Rivers Were Trails* (2019)

If this ends up being too much for the term, then we'll cut material or some of it will become optional. 

# Reading

You do not need to purchase any books for this course. 

On the topic of genre studies, we will read selections of [*Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy*](https://wac.colostate.edu/books/referenceguides/bawarshi-reiff/), by Anis S. Bawarshi and Mary Jo Reiff, as well as ["Genre Troubles in Game Studies,"](https://www.kinephanos.ca/2019/genre-troubles-in-game-studies-ludology-agonism-and-social-action/) by Gerald Voorhees, both of which are open-access (available online).

I will also supplement some of the games listed above with open-access readings. 

See the schedule below for details about what to read and when.
