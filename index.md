# Description

Video games prompt us to play, but how do we tell stories with them? And how do genres shape that storytelling? We'll survey the articulation of video game genres (such as point-and-click, puzzle, role-playing, sim, and platformer) with literary genres (like fantasy, science fiction, mystery, adventure, and horror) to consider how genre affects our understanding, if not our experiences, of narrative and play. We'll attend to short, story-rich games that experiment with genre, and I'll ask you to [select a game](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) to study throughout the term. 

# Learning Goals

I designed this course for you to: 

1. Build a vocabulary for approaching genre as an action instead of a category.
2. Learn a methodology for analyzing what genres *do* in video games and how they mediate the motives and objectives of players.
3. Document, describe, and evaluate the activity of multiple genres in a single game. 
4. Compose your own "player story" *with* a game, not just *about* a game. This means you will relate, interact, and negotiate with a game by treating it as a process rather than a discrete object to be examined from a distance. (I define "player story" in the next section of this syllabus.)

I'll assume you've no previous experience with games or genre studies in an academic context. 

# Assignments

I am asking you to complete five assignments this term: 

1. [Take-Home Exam 1](exam1.html) (22.5% of your final mark; response due by Friday, February 3rd at 11:30am). 
2. [Activity Analysis](activity.html) for your player story (20% of your final mark; response recommended by Friday, February 17th but required by Wednesday, March 1st).  
3. [Take-Home Exam 2](exam2.html) (22.5% of your final mark; response due by Wednesday, March 22nd).
4. [Workshops](workshops.html) to develop and refine your player stories (5% of your final mark; conducted in class March 28th - 31st).
5. [Player Story](final.html) about a game and its genres (30% of your final mark; response due by Tuesday, April 18th). 

This combination of exams (1 and 3 above) and a project (2, 4, and 5) should help you to account for the fundamentals of genre studies while developing a specific line of inquiry through a single game. As a reminder, I am asking you to select one game from [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) to study for the entire term. 

*Brightspace*: Please use Brightspace to submit all your work. I will assess each assignment based on a rubric communicated in its respective prompt (see links above). You do not need to purchase any software to use Brightspace; however, you'll need your UVic NetLink ID, access to the internet, and a computer.  

*Feedback*: I will provide feedback on all assignments, with most of my energies dedicated to your Activity Analysis (see #2 above), which will be incredibly important as you prepare your Player Story (see #5 above). If you respond to all assignments on time, then you will know 70% of your final mark by Thursday, April 6th (the last day of classes). 

*Exams*: I will distribute the questions for Take-Home Exams 1 and 2 *two weeks* in advance of their respective due dates. Responses will be short-answer, and the exams will be open-book, meaning you're allowed to use your notes, assigned readings, and other resources to address the questions. The exams will cover lectures, games, and readings in the course. Please also note that I will not hold a final exam for this course during UVic's final exam period in April. 

*Activity Analysis*: This assignment will ask you to start conducting genre research for your Player Story. I will circulate the prompt for this assignment *two weeks* in advance of the due date. To complete the assignment, you will need to [select a game](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) to study this term. I recommend submitting your response by Friday, February 17th. This way, you'll know 42.5% of your final mark before February 28th, which is the last day to withdraw without penalty of failure. However, you are welcome to submit your response as late as Wednesday, March 1st.

*Workshops*: I will facilitate a series of workshops in late March intended to help you develop and refine your Player Story, which is due on Tuesday, April 18th. I will distribute worksheets for you to complete with peers in small groups and then return to me for assessment when the workshops are finished.

*Player Story*: The "player story" is a methodology [my lab](https://uvicpraxis.github.io/) developed to engage genre and narrative in games. 

A player story documents the following experiences of a game: 

1. Playing and reacting to it, 
2. Making meaning of it, 
3. Being affected by it, and 
4. Arguing with it and all its contradictions.

A player story is, in the words of Kishonna Gray, a "narrative description" of a game as a system of activities. Player stories are both personal and social, and their authors toggle between immersion and critical distance. 

The two most common formats for player stories are:  

1. Video essays with voice-over narration and 
2. Written essays with images and/or embedded media such as video and audio. 

You'll choose one of these two formats for your Player Story in this course, and I'll dedicate a few class meetings to studying and composing player stories about games, narrative, and genre. I will circulate the prompt for this assignment in February, when I circulate the prompt for the Activity Analysis.  

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: “JEN-tree.” Or you can call me Doctor Sayers or Professor Sayers if you prefer. I spend 14.32% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about games, media, and fiction. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. I've been at UVic, on lək̓ʷəŋən and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ territories, since 2011. I teach courses for UVic English, and I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca) or find me in CLE D331. 

# Games

I am asking you to select *one* of the following games to study and play throughout the term. I will touch upon each of these games at some point during lectures (often with screen caps and recordings) but will go into depth about only a few of them. (See the [schedule](#schedule) below for details. Note that we will spend the most class time talking about *80 Days*, *Gris*, and *Citizen Sleeper*.) 

To make this list, I focused on games published since 2010 that are story-rich, cost less than 30 CAD, are available on multiple platforms (ideally one that's mobile), and require no more than ten hours to complete, hence the absence of notable works such as *Disco Elysium*, *Inscryption*, *Mass Effect 2*, *Pentiment*, and *Outer Wilds*.

I recommend reviewing [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) before selecting one of these games to study for the term. It includes the tagline, game genre(s), literary genre(s), cameras and perspectives, average cost, platforms (including mobile), average number of hours to completion, content warnings, and URL for each game, plus some notes. If you encounter any errors or mistakes, then please let me know. I'll correct them. 

Again, please pick only *one* game from the following list to study this term.

* *80 Days* (2014)
* *Butterfly Soup* (2017)
* *Card Shark* (2022)
* *Citizen Sleeper* (2022)
* *Eliza* (2019)
* *Even the Ocean* (2016) 
* *Firewatch* (2016)
* *Get in the Car, Loser!* (2021) 
* *Gris* (2018)
* *Immortality* (2022) 
* *Inside* (2016)
* *Kentucky Route Zero* (2013-20)
* *Neo Cab* (2019)
* *Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna)* (2014)
* *Night in the Woods* (2017) 
* *NORCO* (2022)
* *Oxenfree* (2016)
* *Portal 2* (2011)
* *Return of the Obra Dinn* (2018)
* *Signalis* (2022)
* *Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe* (2022) 
* *Strange Horticulture* (2022)
* *That Dragon, Cancer* (2016)
* *To The Moon* (2011) 
* *Umurangi Generation* (2020)
* *Unpacking* (2021) 
* *When Rivers Were Trails* (2019)

If this ends up being too much for the term, then we'll cut material or some of it will become optional. 

# Reading

You do not need to purchase any books for this course. 

On the topic of genre studies, we will read selections of [*Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy*](https://wac.colostate.edu/books/referenceguides/bawarshi-reiff/), by Anis S. Bawarshi and Mary Jo Reiff, as well as ["Genre Troubles in Game Studies,"](https://www.kinephanos.ca/2019/genre-troubles-in-game-studies-ludology-agonism-and-social-action/) by Gerald Voorhees, both of which are open-access (available online without paywalls).

I will also supplement some of the games listed above with optional material: open-access readings, video, and podcast episodes. 

See the schedule below for details about what to read and when.  

# Workload

The most important thing to know about this course is that *I'll opt for care in every instance.* If the workload becomes too much, or we're juggling more than we should, then we'll cut materials. I've planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.

I suggest dedicating 3 to 5 hours of study to English 391 each week, plus 3 hours for weekly meetings (TWF). Of course, 3 to 5 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the work and materials involved.

In Brightspace, I will also message you once each week (usually on Fridays) with an update on how the course is progressing and what you might consider as we move forward (to plan for reading, games, assignments, due dates, and whatnot).
