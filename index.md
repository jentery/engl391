# Territory Acknowledgement 

As a researcher and instructor at the University of Victoria, I acknowledge and respect the lək̓ʷəŋən peoples on whose traditional territory the University stands, and the Songhees, Esquimalt, and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day. I'm a setter scholar at UVic, and I arrived here as a guest in July 2011. 

The fact that we're gathering here to study games and genre in an English course is one consequence of colonization and injustice upon local lands and peoples. I will make no assumptions about you or your knowledge of the lands on which we'll work this term; however, if you want to know more about territory acknowledgements, then for now I'll say I have personally learned a lot from, and am deeply grateful for, this [webpage](https://www.uvicnsu.ca/about/lands) written by the Native Students Union about territory acknowledgements as well as this August 2019 [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/76wRKpfhNDS08ehRvtETmR) of *U in the Ring* titled, "With Knowledge Comes Responsibility: Territory Acknowledgements," with Jeff Ganohalidoh Corntassel, Maggie Easton, Steve Farina, Robbie Lewis, Qwul'sih'yah'maht Robina Thomas, and Kolin Sutherland-Wilson. I also invite ongoing dialogue with you about territory acknowledgements and how UVic students, faculty, and staff are giving back to local lands and people.

# Description

Video games prompt us to play, but how do we tell stories with them? And how do genres shape that storytelling? We'll survey the articulation of video game genres (such as point-and-click, puzzle, role-playing, sim, and platformer) with literary genres (like fantasy, science fiction, mystery, adventure, and horror) to consider how genre affects our understanding, if not our experiences, of narrative and play. We'll attend to short, story-rich games that experiment with genre, and I'll ask you to [select a game](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) to study throughout the term. 

# Learning Goals

I designed this course for you to: 

1. Build a vocabulary for approaching genre as an action instead of a category.
2. Learn a methodology for analyzing what genres *do* in video games and how they mediate the motives and objectives of players.
3. Document, describe, and evaluate the activity of multiple genres in a single game. 
4. Compose your own "Player Story" *with* a game, not just *about* a game. This means you will relate, interact, and negotiate with a game by treating it as a process rather than a discrete object to be examined from a distance. (I define "Player Story" in the next section of this syllabus.)

I'll assume you've no previous experience with games or genre studies in an academic context. 

# Assignments

I am asking you to complete five assignments this term: 

1. [Take-Home Exam 1](exam1.html) (22.5% of your final mark; response due by Friday, February 3rd at 11:30am). 
2. [Activity Analysis](activity.html) for your player story (20% of your final mark; response recommended by Friday, February 17th but required by Wednesday, March 1st).  
3. [Take-Home Exam 2](exam2.html) (22.5% of your final mark; response due by Wednesday, March 22nd).
4. [Workshops](workshops.html) to develop and refine your player stories (5% of your final mark; conducted in class March 28th - 31st).
5. [Player Story](final.html) about a game and its genres (30% of your final mark; response due by Tuesday, April 18th). 

This combination of exams (1 and 3 above) and a project (2, 4, and 5 above) should help you to account for the fundamentals of genre studies while developing a specific line of inquiry through a single game. Again, I am asking you to select one game from [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) to study for the entire term. 

*Brightspace*: Please use Brightspace to submit all your work. You do not need to purchase any software to use Brightspace; however, you'll need your UVic NetLink ID, access to the internet, and a computer.  

*Feedback*: I will provide feedback on each assignment according to its rubric, with most of my energies dedicated to your Activity Analysis (see #2 above), which will be incredibly important as you prepare your Player Story (see #5 above). If you respond to all assignments on time, then you will know 70% of your final mark by Thursday, April 6th (the last day of classes). 

*Exams*: I will distribute the questions for Take-Home Exams 1 and 2 *two weeks* in advance of their respective due dates. Responses will be short-answer, and the exams will be open-book, meaning you're allowed to use your notes, assigned readings, and other resources to address the questions. The exams will cover lectures, games, and readings in the course. Please also note that I will not hold a final exam for this course during UVic's final exam period in April. 

*Activity Analysis*: This assignment will ask you to start conducting genre research for your Player Story. I will circulate the prompt for it *two weeks* in advance of the due date. To complete the assignment, you will need to [select a game](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) to study this term. I recommend submitting your response by Friday, February 17th. This way, you'll know 42.5% of your final mark before February 28th, which is the last day to withdraw from this course without penalty of failure. However, you are welcome to submit your response as late as Wednesday, March 1st. 

*Workshops*: I will facilitate a series of writing and research workshops in late March. They will help you develop and refine your Player Story well before it's due on Tuesday, April 18th. During these workshops, I will distribute worksheets for you to complete with peers in small groups and then return to me for assessment.

*Player Story*: A "Player Story" is a methodology [my lab](https://uvicpraxis.github.io/) developed to engage genre and narrative in games. 

A Player Story documents the following experiences of a game: 

1. Playing and reacting to it, 
2. Making meaning of it, 
3. Being affected by it, and 
4. Arguing with it and all its contradictions.

A Player Story is, in the words of Kishonna Gray, a "narrative description" of a game as a system of activities. Player Stories are both personal and social, and their authors toggle between immersion and critical distance. 

The two most common formats for Player Stories are:  

1. Video essays with voice-over narration and 
2. Written essays with images and/or embedded media such as video and audio. 

You'll choose one of these two formats for your Player Story in this course, and I'll dedicate a few class meetings to studying and composing Player Stories about games, narrative, and genre. I will circulate the prompt for this assignment in early February alongside the prompt for the Activity Analysis.  

# Games

I am asking you to select *one* of the following games to study and play throughout the term for the purposes of your final Player Story (see the [assignments](#assignments)). I will touch upon each of these games at some point during lectures (often with screen caps and recordings) but will go into depth about only three of them: *80 Days*, *Gris*, and *Citizen Sleeper*. (See the [schedule](#schedule) below for details.) Please watch or play these three games if you can. You're also welcome to select one of them to study and play for your Player Story. 

I recommend reviewing [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6maql6wsx51M6B5YLhgS8cDdqwJXTajUE8Kv5McgLw/edit#gid=0) before selecting a game. It includes the tagline, game genre(s), literary genre(s), cameras and perspectives, average cost, platforms (including mobile), average number of hours to completion, content warnings, and URL for each game, plus some notes. If you encounter any errors or mistakes, then please let me know. I'll correct them. 

To make the following list, I focused on games published since 2010 that are story-rich, cost less than 30 CAD, are available on multiple platforms (ideally one that's mobile), and require no more than ten hours to complete, hence the absence of notable works such as *Disco Elysium*, *Inscryption*, *Mass Effect 2*, *Pentiment*, and *Outer Wilds*.

* *80 Days* (2014)
* *Butterfly Soup* (2017)
* *Card Shark* (2022)
* *Citizen Sleeper* (2022)
* *Eliza* (2019)
* *Even the Ocean* (2016) 
* *Firewatch* (2016)
* *Get in the Car, Loser!* (2021) 
* *Gris* (2018)
* *Immortality* (2022) 
* *Inside* (2016)
* *Kentucky Route Zero* (2013-20)
* *Neo Cab* (2019)
* *Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna)* (2014)
* *Night in the Woods* (2017) 
* *NORCO* (2022)
* *Oxenfree* (2016)
* *Portal 2* (2011)
* *Return of the Obra Dinn* (2018)
* *Signalis* (2022)
* *Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe* (2022) 
* *Strange Horticulture* (2022)
* *That Dragon, Cancer* (2016)
* *To The Moon* (2011) 
* *Umurangi Generation* (2020)
* *Unpacking* (2021) 
* *When Rivers Were Trails* (2019)

If this ends up being too much for the term, then we'll cut material or some of it will become optional. 

# Reading

You do not need to purchase any books for this course. 

On the topic of genre studies, we will read: 

* Selections of [*Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy*](https://wac.colostate.edu/books/referenceguides/bawarshi-reiff/), by Anis S. Bawarshi and Mary Jo Reiff, and 
* ["Genre Troubles in Game Studies,"](https://www.kinephanos.ca/2019/genre-troubles-in-game-studies-ludology-agonism-and-social-action/) by Gerald Voorhees.

Both of these publications are open-access (available online without paywalls). 

I will also supplement some of the games listed above with optional material: open-access readings, video, and podcast episodes. 

See the [schedule](#schedule) below for details about what to read and when.  

# Workload

The most important thing to know about this course is that *I'll opt for care in every instance.* If the workload becomes too much, or we're juggling more than we should, then we'll cut materials. I've planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.

I suggest dedicating 3 to 5 hours of study to English 391 each week, plus 3 hours for weekly meetings (TWF). Of course, 3 to 5 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the work and materials involved.

In Brightspace, I will also message you once each week (usually on Fridays) with an update on how the course is progressing and what you might consider as we move forward (to plan for reading, games, assignments, due dates, and whatnot).

# Schedule

Coming soon.

### Accessibility

If you have a disability or health consideration that may require supports, please feel free to approach me and/or the [Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL)](https://www.uvic.ca/services/cal/) as soon as possible. CAL staff are available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals, and arrange appropriate supports. I will never ask you to disclose a diagnosis, health consideration, or disability to me, and I know that access needs are social, cultural, and structural issues that aren't always addressed, or adequately addressed, by institutions such as the academy. 

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 

I aim to create an inclusive learning environment that attends to difference and honours each of you, including your experiences as well as the intersections of race, gender, disability, sexuality, religion, power, and class. I want to be a resource for you, and I am still learning. If something is said in class (by anyone, including me) that makes you feel uncomfortable, then don't hesitate to talk with me. If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your university records, then let me know and I'll correct the documents provided to me. If your performance in the class is being impeded by your experiences outside of class, then keep me posted and we'll make adjustments. I also welcome any suggestions to improve the quality of the course and/or its culture and materials, and I will make available mechanisms for anonymous feedback since you may prefer them. If you'd rather speak with someone outside the course, then Luke Carson (chair) and Erin Ellerbeck (undergraduate adviser) in English are excellent resources.  

The following student groups may be relevant to your life as a student here at UVic: 

* [The Native Students Union](https://www.uvicnsu.ca/home) "is a community group for Indigenous students at UVic. Our space in the SUB is open to self-identifying Indigenous students who want to work, study, lounge, have lunch, or connect with other students. We're also located in the First Peoples House.

*Language for this policy was drawn from the Harriet W. Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning at Brown University and the work of Monica Linden in particular.*

### Basic Needs 

I want you to thrive in this course and everywhere else. Please let me know as early as possible if you have any concerns or if you require any supports to succeed. I'll do my best to help. If, for instance, you need to cover gaps in care, then please don't hesitate to bring your children to class meetings. Babies who are nursing are always welcome, as I do not want you to choose between feeding your child and continuing your education. 

UVic takes student mental health very seriously, with a [website](https://www.uvic.ca/mentalhealth/) full of resources. They offer services such as assistance and referral to address students' personal, social, career, and study skills concerns. Services for students also include crisis and emergency mental health consultation, confidential assessment, and counselling services (individual and small group). Many of these programs are connected with Health Services, which you may contact by phone. 

The [Student Services website](https://www.uvic.ca/studentaffairs/departments/student-services/index.php) lists several policies, a knowledge of which may make your life at UVic safer and easier. Only some of them are directly related to this course, but they're still important.

*Language for this policy was drawn from the work of Richard Pickard at UVic.*

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: “JEN-tree.” You can call me Doctor Sayers or Professor Sayers if you prefer. I spend 14.32% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about games, media, and fiction. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. I've been at UVic, on lək̓ʷəŋən and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ territories, since 2011. I teach courses for UVic English, and I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca) or find me in CLE D331.
