## Images 

This section covers the use of screengrabs and still photos as well as photographs of the play environment. 

**Tech Required**

-	Overall, tech needed is very minimal.
-	Screenshot and screen capture capabilities are available on most newer platforms (PC, Mac, mobile phone, PS5, Xbox S/X, Nintendo Switch). 
-	Shortcuts exist on Mac, PC, and mobile phones to easily save images. 
-	Mac: Cmd + Shift + 3, PC: Windows key + Shifc + S
-	Create button on PS5, share button on XBox, Capture button on Nintendo Switch
-	Photos of the play environment likely require a camera or phone (if you want to photograph the physical environment in which you play games).
-	Ability to transfer files (through an app, e.g.) from your console or phone to your computer may be helpful. 
-	You can take still images from video recordings of play session as well. 

**Planning Required**

-	You may need to learn shortcuts and decide which method of capturing play is most suitable or easiest. 
-	Which aspects of the play session do you want to capture? Story elements? The art or design? The mechanics?  
-	Do you need or wish to be included (as a player) in the documentation? For instance, do your reactions or environment play a significant role in your research? 

**Benefits of Using Images** 

-	Documenting play through images usually requires very little preparation or knowledge of tech.
-	Files can be included within a repository (folder/repo of files) or integrated into your writing as evidence or a reference to a primary source. 
-	Small file sizes (doesn't require much storage) 
-	For reflection, you can point to a particular moment in a play session (for example, "see image_01" or "see Figure A").
-	Images can be easily referenced and worked into longer essays. 

**Limitations of Using Images**

-	May be limited in degree of information as a sole piece of documentation
-	No sound or movement
-	Academic publications (outside of coursework) will likely require written permission from publishers or developers to use images of their work. 
-	Requires some knowledge of file management

**Examples**

-	Documenting the physical environment of your play sessions might look something like Image 1 in ["Pursuits for the Heart: *Monument Valley 2* and Intergenerational Play”](https://press.etc.cmu.edu/journals/well-played-vol-8-no-2) by Lauren Cruikshank (*Well Played* Vol. 8, No. 2)
-	Your images may also document your gear and setup or your point-of-view during the play session.
-	An example of screenshots taken during a play session can be found in ["Rebel Inc., Colonialism Simulator”](http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/rebel-inc-colonialism-simulator/) by Alex Adams (*First Person Scholar* Jul 27, 2022)
-	Figures 1, 2, and 3 from ["The Dilemmas of a Disco Cop”](https://press.etc.cmu.edu/journals/well-played-vol-11-no-1) by Mia Consalvo, E. Jules Maier-Zucchino, and Robert Marinov (*Well Played* Vol. 11, No. 1) demonstrate the use of images in academic writing.

## Logs 

This section covers the use of pen and paper, notes, a word processor, and other writing tools. 

**Tech Required**

-	Overall, very accessible with minimal tech required  
-	Pen and paper are basic tools for a log or journal. 
-	Word processor: MS Word, Google Docs, notes app, etc.
-	Documenting play through a log might rely on a descriptive (re-creation of game or play session), expository (explaining the game or play session), narrative (telling a story about the play session), and/or persuasive (written commentary or analysis on play session) method in writing.

**Planning Required**

-	You may need to consider which details of the play session are most important for the sake of documentation. 
-	You may also need to consider when the documenting will take place: before, during, and/or afterwards?

**Benefits of Keeping a Log**

-	For reflection, documenting through a log allows the writer to focus on the feelings evoked within the experience of play. 
-	For writing academically, documenting play sessions through a log can also yield a primary source similar to that of a personal ethnography or autoethnography.

**Limitations of Keeping a Log**

-	May be limited in its capacity to describe visual, audio and/or narrative aspects of a play session, especially if you are trying to document the simultaneity of those elements. 
-	Depending on the outcome or goals of the documentation, a log may have a limited or specific use as a primary source beyond reflection.
-	It may be best to approach with a single goal or purpose in mind. 

**Examples**

-	An example of a log (as part of a mixed methods approach) is Ashely Bardhan’s ["The New Marvel XCOM-Like Seems Good Enough to Turn Me, A Hater, into A Fan”](https://kotaku.com/marvel-midnight-suns-impressions-xcom-firaxis-pc-rpg-1849793171) (Kotaku).
-	"#Me2, #Me4, Black Women, and Misogynoir" by Kishonna Gray , pages 94-95 and 101-102, contain examples of a log, (auto)ethnography, and accompanying reflection.
-	A log may also take the form of a diary or journal of events and encounters within a play session.
