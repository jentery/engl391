# Documentation Guide 

Some tips for documenting your experiences playing games . . . 

*Note to Sangeev*: The audience here is a UVic undergraduate student in a 300-level English course. We'll need to avoid academic and technical jargon. Also, this is just an outline. Feel free to expand or refine wherever you see fit. Let's aim for one page (print / PDF, single-spaced, 11-point Calibri) per approach. If we can't make that fit, then we'll probably need to remove a section, reduce the number of examples, or the like. Finally, we'll need to mention on every page that they should *not* make their documentation public. 

## Images 

**Tech Required**: *Note to Sangeev*: No need to mention brands. Something generic, including "screen capture software," should work. Images here may be screen caps, photographs of the player in context (where they're playing), screen caps + camera views of the player . . . 

**Planning Required**: *Note to Sangeev*: planning in terms of setup or preparing play sessions for recording or documentation; basically, the labour required to get it going 

**Benefits**: *Note to Sangeev*: specifically, benefits for reflection, providing access to a primary source, and writing critically or academically about games 

**Limitations**: *Note to Sangeev*: specifically, limitations with respect to reflection, providing access to a primary source, and writing critically or academically about games

**Three Examples**: *Note to Sangeev*: Perhaps specific articles / essays from http://gamestudies.org/2203/, http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/, and https://press.etc.cmu.edu/publications/well-played/journal_series/well-played? I'm open to others. 

## Log

**Tech Required**: *Note to Sangeev*: No need to mention brands. Something generic, including "pen and paper," should work. A log here is likely descriptive (re-creating the game or play session in writing) but may also be expository (explaining the game or play session in writing), narrative (telling a story in writing about the play session), and/or persuasive (written commentary or analysis during the session).

**Limitations**: *Note to Sangeev*: specifically, limitations with respect to reflection, providing access to a primary source, and writing critically or academically about games

**Three Examples**: *Note to Sangeev*: Perhaps something from https://lparchive.org/ and . . . ? Again, I'm open to suggestions. 

## Audio 

**Tech Required**: *Note to Sangeev*: No need to mention brands. Something generic, including "audio recorder" and "sound capture software," should work. Audio here may be the audio version of the log (above), sound captures of in-game audio, and/or player remarks + vocalizations in real-time.

**Benefits**: *Note to Sangeev*: specifically, benefits for reflection, providing access to a primary source, and writing critically or academically about games

**Limitations**: *Note to Sangeev*: specifically, limitations with respect to reflection, providing access to a primary source, and writing critically or academically about games

**Three Examples**: *Note to Sangeev*: Perhaps something from Twitch, YT, or a podcast? Again, I'm open to suggestions. 

## Video (no commentary) 

**Tech Required**: *Note to Sangeev*: No need to mention brands. Something generic, including "screen recorder," should work. Video here may be the video version of the log (above), screen recordings, and/or video of physical player activity and expression in real-time.  

**Planning Required**: *Note to Sangeev*: planning in terms of setup or preparing play sessions for recording or documentation; basically, the labour required to get it going

**Three Examples**: *Note to Sangeev*: Perhaps something from Twitch or YT? Again, I'm open to suggestions. 

## Video with Voice-Over

**Tech Required**: *Note to Sangeev*: No need to mention brands. Something generic, including "broadcasting software," should work. Video w/ VO here may be the video version of the log (above), screen recordings with real-time voice commentary, and/or video of physical player activity and commentary in real-time.

**Three Examples**: *Note to Sangeev*: Perhaps something from Twitch or YT? Again, I'm open to suggestions. An academic or critical example (as long as it's documentation and not an essay) would be cool.
