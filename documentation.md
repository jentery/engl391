## Images 

This section covers the use of screengrabs and still photos as well as photographs of the play environment. 

**Tech Required**

-	Overall, tech needed is very minimal.
-	Screenshot and screen capture capabilities are available on most newer platforms (PC, Mac, mobile phone, PS5, Xbox S/X, Nintendo Switch). 
-	Shortcuts exist on Mac, PC, and mobile phones to easily save images. 
-	Mac: Cmd + Shift + 3, PC: Windows key + Shifc + S
-	Create button on PS5, share button on XBox, Capture button on Nintendo Switch
-	Photos of the play environment likely require a camera or phone (if you want to photograph the physical environment in which you play games).
-	Ability to transfer files (through an app, e.g.) from your console or phone to your computer may be helpful. 
-	You can take still images from video recordings of play session as well. 
-	When in doubt, or when you're pressed for time, you can just photograph your screen. 

**Planning Required**

-	You may need to learn shortcuts and decide which method of capturing play is most suitable or easiest. 
-	Which aspects of the play session do you want to capture? Story elements? The art or design? The mechanics?  
-	Do you need or wish to be included (as a player) in the documentation? For instance, do your reactions or environment play a significant role in your research? 

**Benefits of Using Images** 

-	Documenting play through images usually requires very little preparation or knowledge of tech.
-	Files can be included within a repository (folder/repo of files) or integrated into your writing as evidence or a reference to a primary source. 
-	Small file sizes (doesn't require much storage) 
-	For reflection, you can point to a particular moment in a play session (for example, "see image_01" or "see Figure A").
-	Images can be easily referenced and worked into longer essays. 

**Limitations of Using Images**

-	May be limited in degree of information as a sole piece of documentation
-	No sound or movement
-	Academic publications (outside of coursework) will likely require written permission from publishers or developers to use images of their work. 
-	Requires some knowledge of file management

**Examples**

-	Documenting the physical environment of your play sessions might look something like Image 1 in ["Pursuits for the Heart: *Monument Valley 2* and Intergenerational Play”](https://press.etc.cmu.edu/journals/well-played-vol-8-no-2) by Lauren Cruikshank (*Well Played* Vol. 8, No. 2)
-	Your images may also document your gear and setup or your point-of-view during the play session.
-	An example of screenshots taken during a play session can be found in ["Rebel Inc., Colonialism Simulator”](http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/rebel-inc-colonialism-simulator/) by Alex Adams (*First Person Scholar* Jul 27, 2022)
-	Figures 1, 2, and 3 from ["The Dilemmas of a Disco Cop”](https://press.etc.cmu.edu/journals/well-played-vol-11-no-1) by Mia Consalvo, E. Jules Maier-Zucchino, and Robert Marinov (*Well Played* Vol. 11, No. 1) demonstrate the use of images in academic writing.

## Logs 

This section covers the use of pen and paper, notes, a word processor, and other writing tools. 

**Tech Required**

-	Overall, very accessible with minimal tech required  
-	Pen and paper are basic tools for a log or journal. 
-	Word processor: MS Word, Google Docs, notes app, etc.
-	Documenting play through a log might rely on a descriptive (re-creation of game or play session), expository (explaining the game or play session), narrative (telling a story about the play session), and/or persuasive (written commentary or analysis on play session) method in writing.

**Planning Required**

-	You may need to consider which details of the play session are most important for the sake of documentation. 
-	You may also need to consider when the documenting will take place: before, during, and/or afterwards?

**Benefits of Keeping a Log**

-	For reflection, documenting through a log allows the writer to focus on the feelings evoked within the experience of play. 
-	For writing academically, documenting play sessions through a log can also yield a primary source similar to that of a personal ethnography or autoethnography.

**Limitations of Keeping a Log**

-	May be limited in its capacity to describe visual, audio and/or narrative aspects of a play session, especially if you are trying to document the simultaneity of those elements. 
-	Depending on the outcome or goals of the documentation, a log may have a limited or specific use as a primary source beyond reflection.
-	It may be best to approach with a single goal or purpose in mind. 

**Examples**

-	An example of a log (as part of a mixed methods approach) is Ashely Bardhan’s ["The New Marvel XCOM-Like Seems Good Enough to Turn Me, A Hater, into A Fan”](https://kotaku.com/marvel-midnight-suns-impressions-xcom-firaxis-pc-rpg-1849793171) (Kotaku).
-	"#Me2, #Me4, Black Women, and Misogynoir" by Kishonna Gray , pages 94-95 and 101-102, contain examples of a log, (auto)ethnography, and accompanying reflection.
-	A log may also take the form of a diary or journal of events and encounters within a play session.

## Audio

This section covers audio capture of game sounds as well as player commentary, including voice-over.

**Tech Required**

-	Overall, can be done with minimal knowledge of tech
-	To document play through audio, you will need a device capable of recording audio or capturing sound (Audacity, QuickTime, or OBS, for example). 
-	Audio may assume the form of a log (similar to a written log), capture of game sounds, and/or real-time commentary and expressions. 
-	You will need a microphone if you wish to record real-time commentary or voice-over. 
-	You may also need a USB audio interface (like a Focusrite Scarlett) to connect mics to a computer. 

**Planning Required**

-	Requires some time to setup and find a way to record either game sound and/or player voice
-	Set up software or external equipment, including mic checks 
-	May need to work out how to transfer or merge files if recorded on separate platforms
-	May require sound checks to ensure the audio gets recorded in a clear way. 
-	If you're recording audio and video through game capture at the same time, then the audio might need to be ripped or recorded separately. 

**Benefits of Using Audio**

-	Audio can be an accessible way of capturing often ignored or overlooked real-time interaction, including a player's unscripted remarks 
-	Opportunity to comment or narrate over video capture of a play session (voice-over commentary) 
-	Can be easily referenced by pointing to time-stamps ("see Audio Log 01 @ 00:12:33")

**Limitations of Using Audio** 

-	May take several tries to get right. 
-	Acoustics and ambient noise play a significant role in recording and fidelity. 
-	Audio recording can vary by equipment and settings (noise-gate, external noise, etc.).
-	Requires some knowledge of recording and file management, and audio files are typically larger than image or text files, for example. 

**Examples** 

-	["Early Let's Play - Gradius III (SNES) Audio Only Playthrough - Early 90s (1992?)"](https://youtu.be/XeA5SvVyQw8) by DDCecil is an example of an audio recording made during a play session.
-	The audio portion of this video is an example of commentary: [“Journey Walkthrough Part 1 - THE JOURNEY BEGINS - Let's Play Gameplay/Commentary”](https://youtu.be/lPUqJ0lXT6E) by jacksepticeye. 
-	Play documented by audio might also take the style of a log or journal through a podcast-like set of reflections. 

## Video without Commentary 

This section covers video gameplay footage as well as "silent" Let’s Plays. 

**Tech Required**

-	Overall, moderate knowledge of tech required. 
-	Screen capture software or gameplay capture (OBS, Nvidia Game Capture, or an external capture device, for example).
-	May also be a recording of the player during play and their expressions in real-time (time lapse)
-	Gameplay (video of play in action) recorded over the play session might include game audio, but no audio from the player.
-	Physical recording may need camera or mobile phone set up for extended periods of time.
-	Face-cam may need knowledge of screen capture software and/or knowledge of how to integrate two video files. 

**Planning Required**

-	Setup of the software and capture device. Settings can vary between platforms and games.
- Setup may also require more physical space than you need if you're only keeping a log or capturing images, for example
-	Testing to ensure the video is coherent (viewable/playable afterwards) and that storage device has enough space 

**Benefits of Using Video without Commentary**

-	Easily referenced with time-stamps ("See video_1 @ 00:21:20")
-	Collects a lot of information; can capture an entire play session
-	Can be self-explanatory as a recorded play session.
-	For reflections, it can serve as a source to explore certain moments of the play session, including moments you may not have initially noticed. 
-	Increasing accessibility in tech design is making the process easier on certain platforms. 

**Limitations of Using Video without Commentary**

-	May be restricted to what is captured on screen; limited space for your commentary or thoughts (unless you are recording yourself). 
-	Video may lack ability for personal reflection on play session or experience of play.
-	Files sizes can be quite large, and setup can be time-consuming, especially if you don't have a space dedicated to playing games. 

**Examples**

-	Video of long-play: ["Stardew Valley - Relaxing Longplay Fall (No Commentary)”](https://youtu.be/_XfffJIzEtI) by Loopy Longplays
- Another gameplay video: ["Tetris 99 HD Gameplay No Commentary"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOmrLWdWOY)
